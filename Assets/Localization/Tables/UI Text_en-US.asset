    m_Localized: A boy was walking in a forest, heard a noise in a bush and went
      to check what was happening. There he saw a snake and a falcon fighting. He
      asked them what was going on. They replied that they could not split the food
      into equal parts. The boy splitted the meat for them. The animals blessed him
      by giving him the opportunity to become each of them and then back to man whenever
      he wished. At the first opportunity, the boy tested his ability to transform
      and continued on his way.

    m_Localized: The boy transformed into a falcon and stood in the way of the chariot,
      as soon as she saw the falcon he ordered them to stop immediately so that he
      could catch it. Every time she reached for it, it bounced, and after a few
      tries, it finally caught him. She took him to the palace and made him a cage.
      At dusk, when they brought dinner to the king's daughter, she ate and went
      to bed. During the night, the falcon turned into a snake that came out of the
      cage and ate the rest of the dinner and, on the second night, repeated.

    m_Localized: On the third night, angry with her servants, she stayed awake to
      see who was taking the rest of her. She watched, guarded until she fell asleep.
      When she woke up, she saw a boy sitting at the table and having dinner. She
      got up quietly and went to him and asked him what he was doing there. The boy
      explained that he was the falcon she had caught. The next morning she told
      her father that she wanted to get married and wanted bagpipes and drums to
      be ordered. The king indignantly accepted and made a great royal wedding.

    m_Localized: 'The following year the king went to war but was weaker than the
      enemy and barely saved half his army. The boy wanted to fight for him. The
      king agreed.

      The boy waited for the night because then the enemies
      would sleep, turned into a falcon and flew to the enemy camp. There he transformed
      into a boy who began to cut down the enemies, who for fear began to fight among
      themselves. '

    m_Localized: The boy flew into the commotion and went to the messenger and sent
      him with the good news that he had defeated the enemy camp without losing any
      of his soldiers. The next day the boy led his army to the sea to bathe, but
      was eaten by a large fish

    m_Localized: 'The soldiers were frightened because they did not know how to return
      to the king without their hero. They decided to send someone and introduce
      him as his son-in-law, but the king and the king''s daughter realized that
      they were lying to him, making him a falcon and a snake, but he could not.
      The liar confessed and told everything. The king''s daughter took three golden
      apples and made him take him to the place where it happened. She stood on the
      shore and began tossing her apples. '

    m_Localized: The fish saw her and asked her for an apple, but the king's daughter
      told him that if she wanted to get an apple, she must first release the boy
      she had swallowed yesterday. The fish agreed and the Queen threw a golden apple.
      After coming out of the fish, the hero transformed into a falcon and went to
      the palace where everyone greeted him with great joy and honor. The king's
      daughter lived happily ever after with her dear husband.
